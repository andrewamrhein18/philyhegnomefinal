	<b>MPP100 | FINAL PROJECT STATEMENT

Title: Phil Gnome Final 
Semester/Year: Fall 2021
Software: Stop Motion

Description: The artistic inspiration for my project was that my mom collects gnomes all her life. I made it my own by making my own gnome and imaging him where he lives and all his features. The format I choose was Animation short. It’s about my character going around where he lives and in his house. The media techniques were Stop Motion and Adobe Photoshop. It didn’t change from my storyboard. </b>
<b>Sound I uesed for the background "North Oakland Extasy - Squadda B.mp3"</b>
